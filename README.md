# FromMLtoDeepRL 🚀

Welcome to **FromMLtoDeepRL** – a curated journey through the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, covering the fundamentals of **Machine Learning**, diving deep into **Deep Learning**, and venturing into the dynamic realm of **Reinforcement Learning**.

This repository documents my learning and experimentation through:
- 📘 Assignments focused on key algorithms and concepts  
- 🧪 Mini-projects applying those ideas to practical problems  
- 🏁 A capstone project that brings it all together

---

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in ML/DL/RL, understand how different algorithms work, and apply them using modern tools and frameworks like **Scikit-Learn**, **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, and **OpenAI Gym**.
