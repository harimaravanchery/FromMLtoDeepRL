Random Forest  is a supervised classification algorithm. There is a direct relationship between the number of trees in the forest and the results it can get: the larger the number of trees, the more accurate the result. But here creating the forest is not the same as constructing the decision tree with the information gain or gain index approach.\n","\n","The difference between the Random Forest algorithm and the decision tree algorithm is that in Random Forest, the process of finding the root node and splitting the feature nodes will run randomly."],"metadata":{"id":"HaQoVnzxu_-Z"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-12-05T22:24:21.908151Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-12-05T22:24:21.907313Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-12-05T22:24:21.921300Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-12-05T22:24:21.920494Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.049348,"end_time":"2020-12-05T22:24:21.921429","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-05T22:24:21.872081","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"dkuCC27sHBpH"},"outputs":[],"source":["X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.7, random_state=123)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-12-05T22:24:21.990019Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-12-05T22:24:21.988642Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-12-05T22:25:11.139623Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-12-05T22:25:11.140397Z"},"papermill":{"duration":49.189936,"end_time":"2020-12-05T22:25:11.140585","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-05T22:24:21.950649","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"zlbsCyPpHBpI"},"outputs":[],"source":["# YOUR CODE HERE"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Exercise 4**\n","\n","Evaluate the models and display the results ( 2 points)"],"metadata":{"id":"qHgNIvrvd6wu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Model Evaluation\n","\n","To evaluate the performance of a classification model, the following metrics are used:\n","\n","* Confusion matrix\n","  * Accuracy\n","  * Precision\n","  * Recall\n","  * F1-Score"],"metadata":{"id":"sw4YsYjK9Ova"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-12-05T22:25:11.212376Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-12-05T22:25:11.211215Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-12-05T22:25:16.702880Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-12-05T22:25:16.703505Z"},"papermill":{"duration":5.531104,"end_time":"2020-12-05T22:25:16.703687","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-05T22:25:11.172583","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"Obj43wF2HBpI"},"outputs":[],"source":["# YOUR CODE HERE\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.6"},"papermill":{"duration":65.818299,"end_time":"2020-12-05T22:25:16.902366","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2020-12-05T22:24:11.084067","version":"2.1.0"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1YJkLwWqob363OOWjKR_aRzR6llCz_NwB","timestamp":1708447137461}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
